                                    <p>
                                        Working in the pharmacy, I noticed two types of people - those who are eager to pick up their medications and those who do not even realize they have medications ready for pickup. When patients wait
                                        around the pharmacy or constantly call the pharmacy to see if their medications have been filled, pharmacy staff becomes stressed and overwhelmed. When pharmacy staff calls patients to remind them to
                                        pick up their medications that's been sitting in the pharmacy for ten days or it will go back on the shelves, patients become frustrated. So I decided to challenge myself to design a solution that would
                                        effectively bridge the communication gap between the pharmacy and patients.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Design a mobile medication tracker for a pharmacy app that allows patients to track the status of their medication after their prescription has been received by the pharmacy or a prescription refill
                                        request has been submitted.
                                    </p>
                                    <br />
                                    <br />

                                    <p>
                                        I began the challenge by defining user goals and the tasks that users might do.

                                            Designing this feature as a design challenge for myself was a good learning experience. It was certainly nerve-wracking trying to come up with requirements, assumptions, and constraints in such a short period of time to make sure the focus
                                            is on one specific task. What I realized as I was working through this challenge was that I can get a bit too caught up with the little details of things, which makes it easy to miss the bigger picture. In the future, I hope to incorporate
                                            more research into the process as I believe it will better guide me in my design decision and solution.
