                                                    Oftentimes, people choose to cook because it's more cost effective, they have control over what ingredients go into their food, or they might be on a specific diet. However, people are
                                                    also often busy, always on-the-go, and don't always know what food to include in their diet, so cooking can become a tedious task. Is there a quicker way to explore and organize recipes
                                                    all in one place? What can help them save some time? Who can guide them in making the right food choices?

                                                using and what leaves them frustrated, and learned about the types of tasks users perform and in what context. <br />

                                    <p>
                                        To understand exactly what users want to accomplish and how they carry out a set of tasks, I created a mental model. I looked at one of my personas, James, and determined what types of motivation
                                        might be driving his behavior. Then, I went on to create a user journey map and user flow to visualize how James will interact with the app.

                                    <p>
                                        With user journey and user flow, I was able to determine my app screens and design a sitemap. To better design the information architecture of Let's Cook!, I conducted a closed card sorting test using
                                        Optimal Workshop, where 7 participants completed the study.

                                        Next, I designed low-fidelity wireframes to help me flesh out interaction ideas. These screens were chosen to illustrate the navigational components of my app and get an overall idea of how my design
                                        will be laid out.

                                        This process was quick to create and easy to modify, and it allowed more room for creativity without having to worry about the small details.

                                        Once I had the general concept down on paper, I was able to translate my sketches into mid-fidelity wireframes to convey form, function, and specific UI. These wireframes were created using Adobe XD.

                                    <h2>Search for Recipe</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        To create a seamless experience for users to explore recipes, I designed each screen to have a search bar so users can easily and quickly do searches no matter what screen they are on. A filter
                                        function is also available to help users refine their searches.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Search for Experts</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the primary features of Let's Cook! is the ability for users to connect with experts, like nutritionists, dieticians, chefs, to talk about lifestyle changes - what to eat or not to eat when on
                                        a certain diet, what nutrients are important to include, etc. Users can message these experts with their questions, or for more extensive and consistent guidance, they are ablet o book video/audio
                                        calls with their experts.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Create Meal Plans</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        A lot of times, users have busy schedules and don't always have time to figure out what to cook or how longi t would take to prepare meals. I wanted to give them the ability to create meal plans so
                                        that they can plan ahead of time what they will be cooking, what ingredients they need, and how long it would take them to prepare the meals. Additionally, it also enables those who want to improve
                                        their health and those who want to meet their weight goals to stick to well-balanced meals and take control of their nutritional needs.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Add Ingredients to Shopping List</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        "What ingredients do I need again." "Did I buy this yet?" "Where can I buy these ingredients?" These are questions users no longer have to ask as they are now able to add all the ingredients on the
                                        recipe onto their shopping list and be linked to specific stores where they can buy those ingredients when they are ready to order them.

                                    <h2>Typography</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Let's Cook! uses three typefaces - Baumans, Be Vietnam, and Roboto. However, Be Vietnam is the primary typography of teh app. Baumans was used for the logo to keep it fun and inviting, and Roboto was
                                        used for button texts.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The two main colors for this app are white and orange-red. A white background was used to allow the orange-red to pop. The primary text color is black. When a text is clickable or selected, its color
                                        will be orange-red. Accent colors were used for illustrations on the onboarding screens. Orange was used because of its association with joy, happiness, and hunger.

                                            As a person who often looks for new ways to improve my diet and loves cooking, workong on Let's Cook! was really eye-opening and fun. I discovered the importance of having access to nutritionists
                                            and the convenience of linking specific store to the app for ingredients purchase. I also had the opportunity to explore more features on Figma that allowed me to create and improve my design
                                            process for Let's Cook! In the future, I would want to conduct surveys and interviews with a more diverse pool of people to gather a wider range of experiences and perspectives.
