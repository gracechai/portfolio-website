                                        Let's Cook! is an all-in-one app that gives users access to top recipes and nutritionists with the click of a button. With Let's Cook!, users can also plan their meals head of time sand save some
                                        trips to the grocery store.

                                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Oftentimes, people choose to cook because it's more cost effective, they have control over what ingredients go into their food, or they might be on a specific diet. However, people are also often
                                        busy, always on-the-go, and don't always know what food to include in their diet, so cooking can become a tedious task. Is there a quicker way to explore and organize recipes all in one place? What
                                        can help them save some time? Who can guide them in making the right food choices?
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Develop a cooking app that enables users to easily search for recipes, connect with nutritionists to learn more about food choices that promote a healthy lifestyle, create and manage meal plans, and
                                        add ingredients to their shopping list for a seamless grocery shopping experience.

                                    <p>
                                        To understand where Let's Cook! stands in the market and identify the strengths and weaknesses of my competition, I performed a Competitive analysis of three apps: Tasty, AllRecipes, and Yummly.

                                    <p>
                                        Next, a survey was conducted to identify users' needs and their general attitudes about cooking. Then, I documented on users' opinions on cooking apps, determined what apps or sites they enjoy using
                                        and what leaves them frustrated, and learned about the types of tasks users perform and in what context. <br />

                                    <p>
                                        After conducting a survey, I recruited 3 participants to take part in user interviews. Each interview was done over Zoom and took no longer than 30 minutes. All questions were open-ended and they were
                                        aimed at elicting information tied directly to my defined goals.

                                        <li>All interviewees found cooking to be a chore and preferred if it required minimal effort.</li>
                                        <li>Even though interviewees cook everyday, they don't necessarly enjoy it.</li>
                                        <li>Interviewees want a good system to save recipes.</li>
                                        <li>Recipes that include ingredient substitutions would be useful.</li>
                                        <li>Having a feature that readjusts the required ingredients based on the inputted serving size will be helpful.</li>
                                        <li>Access to nutritionists would be helpful when they have questions about selecting the right food to promote a healthy lifestyle.</li>

                                    <p>
                                        To understand exactly what users want to accomplish and how they carry out a set of tasks, I created a mental model. I looked at one of my personas, James, and determined what types of motivation
                                        might be driving his behavior. Then, I went on to create a user journey map and user flow to visualize how James will interact with the app.
                                    </p>
                                    <picture>

                                    <h2>Sitemap</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        With user journey and user flow, I was able to determine my app screens and design a sitemap. To better design the information architecture of Let's Cook!, I conducted a closed card sorting test using
                                        Optimal Workshop, where 7 participants completed the study.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Next, I designed low-fidelity wireframes to help me flesh out interaction ideas. These screens were chosen to illustrate the navigational components of my app and get an overall idea of how my design
                                        will be laid out.

                                        <br />
                                        This process was quick to create and easy to modify, and it allowed more room for creativity without having to worry about the small details.

                                        Once I had the general concept down on paper, I was able to translate my sketches into mid-fidelity wireframes to convey form, function, and specific UI. These wireframes were created using Adobe XD.

                                    <p>
                                        To create a seamless experience for users to explore recipes, I designed each screen to have a search bar so users can easily and quickly do searches no matter what screen they are on. A filter
                                        function is also available to help users refine their searches.

                                        One of the primary features of Let's Cook! is the ability for users to connect with experts, like nutritionists, dieticians, chefs, to talk about lifestyle changes - what to eat or not to eat when on
                                        a certain diet, what nutrients are important to include, etc. Users can message these experts with their questions, or for more extensive and consistent guidance, they are ablet o book video/audio
                                        calls with their experts.

                                    <h2>Create Meal Plans</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        A lot of times, users have busy schedules and don't always have time to figure out what to cook or how longi t would take to prepare meals. I wanted to give them the ability to create meal plans so
                                        that they can plan ahead of time what they will be cooking, what ingredients they need, and how long it would take them to prepare the meals. Additionally, it also enables those who want to improve
                                        their health and those who want to meet their weight goals to stick to well-balanced meals and take control of their nutritional needs.

                                    <p>
                                        Let's Cook! uses three typefaces - Baumans, Be Vietnam, and Roboto. However, Be Vietnam is the primary typography of teh app. Baumans was used for the logo to keep it fun and inviting, and Roboto was
                                        used for button texts.

                                        The two main colors for this app are white and orange-red. A white background was used to allow the orange-red to pop. The primary text color is black. When a text is clickable or selected, its color
                                        will be orange-red. Accent colors were used for illustrations on the onboarding screens. Orange was used because of its association with joy, happiness, and hunger.

                                        As a person who often looks for new ways to improve my diet and loves cooking, workong on Let's Cook! was really eye-opening and fun. I discovered the importance of having access to nutritionists and
                                        the convenience of linking specific store to the app for ingredients purchase. I also had the opportunity to explore more features on Figma that allowed me to create and improve my design process for
                                        Let's Cook! In the future, I would want to conduct surveys and interviews with a more diverse pool of people to gather a wider range of experiences and perspectives.
